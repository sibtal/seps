 @ingroup PrioMgmt
 @brief PrioMgmt lowest bit set look up table.
    Lowest bit set look up table. This is used to find the lowest bit set in a
    byte. To find the lowest bit set in say, 0x34, 0x34 is passed as index to 
    this array to find the lowest bit set in i. Here the answer is 2. This 
    logic doesn't hold good for the value 0.
